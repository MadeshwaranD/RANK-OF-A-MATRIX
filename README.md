# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
Step 1: Import the NumPy library.
Step 2: Define the matrix using a list or array.
Step 3: Use np.linalg.matrix_rank() to compute the rank of the matrix.
Step 4: Display the result.
## Program:
...
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by: 
#RegisterNumber:
#The number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix 
#is known as its rank
import numpy as np
A=[[3,2,5],[1,1,2],[3,3,6]]
rank=np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print(rank)
...
## Output:
