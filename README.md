# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: 
### Step 2: 
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: 
## Program:
...
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by: 
#RegisterNumber:
#The number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix 
#is known as its rank
import numpy as np
A=[[3,2,5],[1,1,2],[3,3,6]]
rank=np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print(rank)
...
## Output:
